# Cribl Access Logs to ASFF Pack

----

Use this Readme to describe what this Pack enables Cribl Stream users to convert access logs into Amazon Security Findings Format (ASFF) and send them to AWS Security Hub via the CloudWatch Log destination tile.

This Pack simplifies the process of transforming Cribl access logs into ASFF-compliant JSON and integrates seamlessly with AWS Security Hub. It provides pre-built pipelines, lookup tables, and configurations to streamline security monitoring and compliance efforts.

## Requirements Section

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

* A Cribl Stream environment running at least `version 4.2`.
* AWS IAM credentials with _`securityhub:BatchImportFindings`_ and **`logs:PutLogEvents`** permissions.


## Configuring the Pack

To configure the Pack for use with AWS Security Hub, follow these steps:

Linux and macOS:

```bash  
# Clone the repository or download the Pack
git clone https://github.com/amiracle/cribl-asff-pack.git

# Import the Pack into Cribl Stream
# Navigate to Packs &gt; Import in the Cribl UI and upload the downloaded Pack file.
```


## Using The Pack

To use this Pack, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Pack**: Go to `Packs &gt; Import` in the Cribl Stream UI and upload the Pack file.
2. **Configure AWS Credentials**: Set up your AWS credentials in the Global Variables section of the Pack:

    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - `AWS_REGION`
3. **Map Severity Levels**: Use the included lookup table (`severity_map.csv`) to adjust log severity levels to ASFF-compliant values.
4. **Route Logs**: Set up a route in Cribl Stream to send access logs through the `CriblLog_to_ASFF` pipeline.
5. **Send Findings**: Configure a CloudWatch Log destination tile in Cribl Stream to forward findings to AWS Security Hub.
